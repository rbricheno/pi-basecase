# pi-basecase
Minimal "case" for a Raspberry Pi model B and a 2.5" ssd/hdd

![Result of printing (badly)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbricheno/pi-basecase/master/pi-basecase-printed.jpg)

I just wanted to connect a Pi to a hard drive so I made this.

For best results, laser cut from the DXF. 3D printing works fine too.

You will also need:

* 4 x M3 standoffs
* 4 x M3 bolts
* 4 x M2.5 standoffs
* 4 x M2.5 bolts
* 4 x M2.5 nuts
